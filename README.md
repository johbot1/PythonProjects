# Python Projects
A collection of projects to prepare me for the final semester of my CS Degree. The following projects are split up according to category: Terminal, GUI, and Web Apps

## Terminal
Terminal projects are the simplest and designed to familiarize myself with the language. While they are numbered, these are not in any specific order, save for the first and last project which I believe to be the easiest and the hardest respectfully. 
Each project in this category must accomplish the following:
  - Make something that primarily uses the Terminal to display, update, and capture information
  - Allow a user to input a variety of information such as numbers, text, and strings
  - Proper error checking and correcting (i.e. When user enters "abc" when prompted for their age, the program handles it appropriately
  - Proper documentation for every function and global variable
### Projects:
1. Mad libs - Allow a user to create a mad libs style word game using various input methods to capture their answers.
2. Guess Who - Using a variety of text based clues, the user is responsible for guessing which historical figure is the chosen before the computer.
3. Roman Numeral Convert - Ever run into a Roman numeral and think, "man, I wish I knew what number that was". Now you can!
4. Text Adventure (Glyph shapes) - A simple text based dungeon adventure with accompanying text based art to complement the written story.
5. Rock Python Scissors - A text based version of Rock Paper Scissors. Simple, sweet, and (hopefully) relatively easy.
6. Text Tac Toe - Draw a simple board to the screen and play some good old fashioned TTT. Great for wasting time.
7. Hangman (Glyph Shapes) - Using text to draw every object, this is a revisioning of the classic word game made in the terminal.
8. Fibonacci Generator - Generates a specified number of Fibonacci sequences. 
9. Fortune Teller - Answer a couple randomized questions and get a fortune!
10. Password Strength Detector - Everyone hates password change day, and understandably so. This project aims to aliviate some of the headaches of new password ownership by allowing the user to check their password strength, along with generating a new one with various parameters including a prefix!


## GUI
GUI projects are designed to be a bit more in depth with not only their visuals, but their code and practicality. While the previous projects could be practical, these GUI designs are meant to be either a stand alone game or an app that could be used on a day to day Projects in this category must accomplish the following:
  - Make something that primarily uses windows, frames, or any other medium of Graphic Interface to display, update, and capture information
  - Allow a user to input a variety of information such as numbers, text, and strings
  - Proper error checking and correcting (i.e. When user enters "abc" when prompted for their age, the program handles it appropriately
  - Proper documentation for every function and global variables
### Projects:
1. Snake -
2. Tetris -
3. Conway's Game of Life - This one has been a goal ever since seeing it in my Intro to Python class in my very first semester. User can change color, speed, and starting crowds.
4. Sudoku - Fun, classic numbers and squares game with a "complete for me" functionality, on those days where you just want to have a completed grid of non repeating numbers from 1-9.
5. Virtual Cookbook - Me and my wife love to cook, but never write down any recipes. Even when we do, organizing those is a pain in of itself. Enter the Virtual Cookbook as the solution!
6. Trail Blazin' Turtles - A visual spirogram using turtles! Gathering the number of colors, points, and even selecting the right shape, this project is meant to be visually trippy and fun.
7. Flappy Bird - The hit game, reimagined inside of Python!
8. Scheduler - Scheduling was never one of my strong suits during my time as a manager. This project aims to produce a fully built schedule based on the team size and time accomidations for each team member.
9. Desktop Reminder - As someone who has ADHD, staying on top of tasks is painful. This attempts to remedy that by creating and displaying a visual reminder at a set time, all of which is configured by the user.
## Web App

### Projects:
1. Email Sender - 
2. Fun Fact generator -
3. Weather App - 
4. YouTube Downloader -
